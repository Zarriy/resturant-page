About Project:
A restaurant page is created by using modular JS. The HTML code of the site is generated using JS.
There are 6 modules, each containing parts of the webpage. These modules are then bundled together
using webpack bundler.

The project also utilises 'css-loader and style loader' dev dependency for making CSS work with the JS. The CSS file is linked to the JS file instead of HTML file. These dev dependencies help in bundling the
CSS along with JS in the dist folder.

There is plenty of room in for creativity and learning.
I hope you liked this project.
thanks for being here.
